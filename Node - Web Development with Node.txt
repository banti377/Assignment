Q1. What is Express.js?

Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It is used to build web applications and APIs quickly and efficiently. Express simplifies the process of creating robust and scalable web applications by providing a set of features for routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests and responses.



Q2. Create localhost server using express.

// Step 1: Install express using npm
// npm install express

// Step 2: Create a file (e.g., server.js) and write the following code

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Define a route for the root URL
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, this is your Express server!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});



Q3. Create basic “Hello world” app using node and express.

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});



Q4. Create a weather app.

i. Use Hbs (Handlebars for templating):

// Install handlebars using npm
// npm install hbs

const express = require('express');
const hbs = require('hbs');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Set up handlebars as the view engine
app.set('view engine', 'hbs');

// Create a views folder in your project directory and add an index.hbs file with your HTML template

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index', {
    title: 'Weather App',
    message: 'Welcome to the Weather App!'
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});


ii. Get country, state, city using an API

iii. Get weather data by city: You will need to integrate with a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API) to fetch weather data by city.



Q5. Create a world clock app.

For a world clock app, you can use a combination of Node.js, Express, and client-side JavaScript for dynamic updates. The app would involve displaying current times in different cities around the world. Integrating with a time zone API can be helpful for accurate time information.

Note: For practical development, additional code, error handling, and API keys for weather and time zone services would be necessary.
